###Features Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz are captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer a-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyacceleration-XYZ and timeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerationMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcceleration-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagnitude.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
